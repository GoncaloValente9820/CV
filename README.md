CV Projects
Those projects were made by me , and they were made so that recruiters and it technicians can see my skills.
Some of them use functions , classes , direct coding all on the same project only to show that i can code using many ways, but i always prefer to use class or functions in order for a better organization/performance.

hope you enjoy ;)
